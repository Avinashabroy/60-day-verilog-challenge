 I designed all the basic logic gates using Verilogâ€”AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR, XOR, and XNOR. I also created detailed testbenches to ensure each gate operates correctly.These gates are essential building blocks of digital circuits.

The gates I designed include:

AND: Outputs true only if both inputs are true.
OR: Outputs true if at least one input is true.
NOT: Inverts the input.
NAND: Outputs true unless both inputs are true.
NOR: Outputs true only if both inputs are false.
XOR: Outputs true if inputs are different.
XNOR: Outputs true if inputs are the same.
