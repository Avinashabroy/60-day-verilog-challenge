Verilog Challenge â€“ Day [2]: The Importance of Signal Direction in Continuous Assignment

As I delve deeper into Verilog, I've come across challenges that push me to rethink the basics. One concept that stands out is continuous assignment and its role in directing signal flow.

Challenge: Design a Verilog module with one input and one output that behaves like a wire. The module should simply pass the input signal directly to the output.


Key Question: In the process, why is it critical to write assign out = in; rather than assign in = out;?

Consideration:

A continuous assignment assigns the right side to the left side continuously, so any change to the RHS is immediately seen in the LHS. Reflect on the roles of `input` and `output` signals in this context. Understanding which signal drives the other is key to ensuring that the module functions as intended.
